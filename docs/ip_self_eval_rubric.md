## Project Information

- **Name:** ____Cleyton Shelton___________  
- **Project Title:** ___Storage App____________  
- **Problem:** Briefly explain why this problem is important
- This is important because my girlfriend and I have moved around a lot in the past year or so. We are moving again to Louisville for my job after I graduate in Spring 26. So we havent really unpacked anything other than the important things. I wanted a way to keep track of our items that are in each box and this allows us quickly find the item we might randomly need instead of ripping through boxes and tearing them up.  
- **Solution:** Briefly explain how your project addresses the problem  
- I made it very simple to be able to add boxes. You simply tap the add box button and fill in the textfields and then add a picture of the box and all its contents. Each box gets assigned a number automatically starting a 1. You can write that number on the box to be able to track the boxes. You can then search for whatever it is that you are looking for via the search bar or by clicking into the boxes to look for the item in a picture. Once the item is found you can look at the top of the detail page to see the box number and go and find your box inside your house.
